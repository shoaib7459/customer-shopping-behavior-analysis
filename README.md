## 🧩 Business Problem'

### Retail businesses collect large amounts of customer transaction data, but this data is often underutilized. Without proper analysis, companies struggle to understand:
  - Which products generate the most revenue
  - Which customer segments contribute the most to sales
  - How purchasing behavior varies across age groups and seasons
  - Whether promotional campaigns and discounts influence purchasing decisions
This project addresses these challenges by analyzing customer shopping data to identify important trends and insights that can support better marketing strategies, customer targeting, and product planning.

  ## Key Features:
    Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)
    Purchase details (Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color)
    Shopping behavior (Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases, Review Rating, Shipping Type)
## 🎯 Key stages of the project include:
  - ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing 
  - ✅ Feature engineering 
  - ✅ Automated data pipeline using Python

- ✅ Clean and standardize column names
- ✅ Perform feature engineering
- ✅ Segment customers based on purchase history
- ✅ Store the cleaned dataset into a MySQL database
- ✅ Log pipeline execution for monitoring
### Pipeline technologies:
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - MYSQL
 - Logging

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
### Several preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data quality:
 - Standardized column names
 - Handled missing values using:
   - Median imputation for numeric columns
   - Mode imputation for categorical columns
 - Converted data types where necessary
 - Removed inconsistencies in categorical values
These steps ensure the dataset is analysis-ready.

## 🧠 Feature Engineering
Additional features were created to enhance analysis.
### Age Group
Customers were categorized into age groups:
| Age Range| Group |
|---------|-------|
| 0-25 | Young Adult | 
| 26-40 | Young |
| 41-60 |Middle Aged |
| 60+ | Senior |

### Customer Segmentation
Customers were segmented based on previous purchase behavior:
|Segment|	Criteria|
|-------|---------|
New|	1 purchase|
Returning|	2–10 purchases|
Loyal	|More than 10 purchases|

This segmentation helps analyze customer loyalty and revenue contribution.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory analysis was performed using Python and visualization libraries to identify patterns and trends.
### Key analyses included:
 - Revenue by product category
 - Revenue by customer gender
 - Customer segmentation analysis
 - Average purchase amount by age group
 - Seasonal sales trends
 - Promotion and discount impact
 - Purchase frequency patterns
 - Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🗃 SQL Analysis
SQL queries were written to perform additional analysis on the cleaned dataset stored in MySQL.
### Examples of SQL analysis include:
  - Top revenue generating products
  - Revenue by customer segment
  - Category performance analysis
  - City-wise revenue ranking
 - Purchase frequency analysis
SQL window functions and aggregations were used to derive insights.
```sql
-- Category Revenue Analysis
SELECT category, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM clean_customer_data
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Top Products by Category
WITH top_ranked_items AS (
    SELECT category, item_purchased, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(purchase_amount) DESC) AS rank
    FROM clean_customer_data
    GROUP BY category, item_purchased
)
SELECT category, item_purchased, total_revenue
FROM top_ranked_items
WHERE rank = 1;
```
